# Electrocardiogram-Time-Series-Classification-Using-2D-CNN

This project demonstrates the classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) time-series data using a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Follow the steps below to set up and run the code.

## Step 1: Install MATLAB

1. Go to the website mentioned in the file below:

   - [Link-MATLAB.txt](Link-MATLAB.txt)

2. Use your Huskers or UNO email ID to get a free license.

3. During installation, make sure to mark **Digital Signal Processing** and **Deep Learning Toolbox**. If you missed this step, you can add the toolboxes later through MATLAB's Add-On Explorer.

## Step 2: Download the ECG Dataset

1. Download the ECG dataset from the link below:

   - [Link-PhysioATM.txt](Link-PhysioATM.txt)

2. Select the **MIT BIH Arrhythmia Database** from the website.

3. Choose the **V5** signals and export the signal as a `.mat` file.

## Step 3: Plot an ECG Waveform in MATLAB

1. After downloading the dataset, you can visualize the ECG waveform in MATLAB using the following script:

   - **ECG_Plot.m**

2. Run the script to generate the ECG waveform.

3. Submit the obtained waveform as a PDF, screenshot, or image file.
